# Unix-based-client-server-program
This project implements a client-server program in C. The server hosts a quiz and handles multiple clients using TCP/IP sockets. The client connects to the server, answers quiz questions, and receives a score at the end. Communication between the client and server is achieved via network sockets for command and response exchange.
